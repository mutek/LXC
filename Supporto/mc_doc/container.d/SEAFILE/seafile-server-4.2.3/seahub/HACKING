About Registration
==================

We use a customized registration process based on thirdpart/registration. 
The customization begins with:

   (r'^accounts/', include('base.registration_urls'))

See base.registration_urls to follow the code.

Registration is seperated into two phase: registration and activation.

    Registration Page with Form -----> Registration Complete Page 
                                      (Notify User to check mail)
                                           |
                                           |
                                           V
                                     User check email and click activate link
                                           |
                                           |
                                           V
       User Home Page          <----- Activate and login User.
                                           

The registration app provide two view functions, i.e., `register` and `activate`.

### Register

The actual registration of the account will be delegated to the
backend; it will be used as follows:

1. The backend's ``registration_allowed()`` method will be called,
   passing the ``HttpRequest``, to determine whether registration of
   an account is to be allowed; if not, a redirect is issued to the
   view corresponding to the named URL pattern
   ``registration_disallowed``.

2. The form to use for account registration will be obtained by
   calling the backend's ``get_form_class()`` method, passing the
   ``HttpRequest``.

3. If valid, the form's ``cleaned_data`` will be passed (as keyword
   arguments, and along with the ``HttpRequest``) to the backend's
   ``register()`` method, which should return the new ``User`` object.

4. Upon successful registration, the backend's
   ``post_registration_redirect()`` method will be called, passing the
   ``HttpRequest`` and the new ``User``, to determine the URL to
   redirect the user to.
 

We use a customized backend: seahub.base.accounts.RegistrationBackend

### Registration Process

Process 1:
1. User register
2. Admin activate
3. User login and bind ccnet ID

To Enable this process, just set

    REGISTRATION_SEND_MAIL = False

Process 2:
1. User register and receive activation email
2. User active account and bind ccnet ID

Process 3:
1. Admin add user
2. User login and bind ccnet ID

About Authentication
====================

We use a custimized authentication method. See
seahub.base.accounts.EmailOrUsernameModelBackend

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'seahub.base.accounts.EmailOrUsernameModelBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend'
)
